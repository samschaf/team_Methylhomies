The codes in this folder were used to derive our final codes. Because we ran many of our codes that used all the probes on Samantha and Hilary's lab computers that had larger processing power we have pieces of code that they ran for everyone. Thus some of our work was fragmented to get the final results. This file is the other peices of our work.

[Heatmaps Dasen](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/final_codes/Heatmaps%20(dasen).Rmd)and [Heatmaps BMIQ](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/final_codes/Heatmaps%20(BMIQ).Rmd) were generated by Hilary using the codes Cassia's codes [script to run on all probes](https://github.com/STAT540-https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/Correction_matters.2.mdUBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/Cassia%20Script%20to%20run%20on%20all%20probes.Rmd), [correction matters 2](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/Correction_matters.2.md) which was on the BMIQ normalized data, [correction matters](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/Correction_matters.md) which was the same code on the Dasen normalized data, as this [analysis](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/analysis_script_v2.Rmd) code from lisa that rearanged the data to working form.

This code for [cell type prediction](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/Cell%20Type%20Prediction.Rmd) was used to help with the cell type correction analysis.
