We are unable to include our data files on github because they are too large.

We were able to upload the [meta data before combat](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/data/processed_data/Meta_uncor.RData) and [after combat](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/data/processed_data/Meta_batch_cor.RData)

Intermediate tables generated during DMR analysis include:

1) Batch corrected analysis   
Annotated list of differentially methlyated probes (DMPs) between brain regions - [here] NEED TO REGENERATE THIS - WILL DO AFTER KNITTING   
List of broad differentially methlyated regions (DMRs) with min, max, and mean for both beta fold change and delta beta (absolute beta difference) - [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/data/processed_data/significant.DMRs_batch.txt)

2) Cell corrected analysis   
Annotated list of differentially methlyated probes (DMPs) between brain regions - [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/data/processed_data/significant.DMPs_cell.txt)   
List of broad differentially methlyated regions (DMRs) with min, max, and mean for both beta fold change and delta beta (absolute beta difference) - [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/data/processed_data/significant.DMRs_cell.txt)
