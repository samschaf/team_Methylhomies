We aim to study the differences in methylation between cerebellum and cortex. For more information on our project please visit our project proposal [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/project_proposal.md)

We will be using methylation data from Hannon *et al.* paper that is publically available. More information about our data set please check it out [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/data)

Our [data folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/data) consists of two subfolders
  - [raw data](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/data/raw_data)
  - [processed data](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/data/processed_data)
  our data set is too large to upload into the repo but we have included the raw and processed meta data.
  
our [background information folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/background_information) is there to provide your with some relevant papers to our project

our [src folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/src) is where the codes used for our analysis are stored. 
  - in [working codes](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/src/working_codes) you will find parts of codes that were created and then shared to help create code for our final analysis codes. Explain through the [README](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/working_codes/README.md)
  - in [final codes](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/src/final_codes) We have the final copies of our code used to optain our results. Detailed explanation of which step they were used for can be found in the [README](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/src/final_codes/README.md)
  
our [results folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/results) contains the decriptions of the aims and conclusions of our analysis steps and the important final images derived from the analysis

other folders

our [resources folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/resources) includes codes that we modified for our analysis. These codes have been referenced in our src where appropriate

our [images folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/Images) includes images we shared with eachother to keep updates on the project and help with trouble shooting

Our final poster can be found in the root directory or [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/Poster.pdf)
