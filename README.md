We aim to study the differences in methylation between cerebellum and cortex. For more information on our project please visit our project proposal [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/blob/master/project_proposal.md)

We will be using methylation data from Hannon *et al.* paper that is publically available. More information about our data set please check it out [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylhomies/tree/master/data)
